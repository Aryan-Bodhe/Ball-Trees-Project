# Ball Tree Project
## Project Aim
The goal of this project is to build and analyze a Ball Tree, an efficient data structure used for organizing points in high-dimensional spaces, with applications in nearest neighbor searches and clustering.

## Completed Tasks
1. Dataset Creation and Plotting:
    - Developed custom datasets and plotters for visualization.
    - Incorporated well-known datasets, including:
    - Sobol Sequence
    - Lithuanian Dataset
    - Latin Center
    - Highleyman Distribution
2. Ball Tree Construction:
    - Median Split Method: Implemented in C++.
    - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Method: Implemented in Python.
    - Our methods are based on research and references, specifically from [this paper] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.00628) and [this paper] (https://steveomohundro.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/omohundro89_five_balltree_construction_algorithms.pdf) and [this paper] (https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/1248547.1248588).

## Future Plans
- Query Implementation:
    - Add support for Ball Tree range queries and k-nearest neighbors (KNN).
    - Conduct performance analysis to evaluate query efficiency.

## Extended Future Plans
- Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN):
    - Explore methods for faster approximate neighbor searches.
    - Research Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and other ANN techniques.
